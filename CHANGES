0.5.2 - CPAN Testers cleanup dealing with dependency specification
cleanliness and conditionalizing non-core module loads / skips.
Includes Kwalitee improvements and support to make REST::Resource more
graceful in a restrictive environment where optional components are
not available (e.g. FCGI, JSON, XML::Dumper).  Fixed POD oddities.

0.5.1 - Deliverable / distribution cleanup to deal with broken
presumption that Module::Build can be replaced by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Also cleaned up actual faults in deliverable.

0.5.0 - Initial release to CPAN and significant fork from
WWW::Resource.
