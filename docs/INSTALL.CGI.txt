OVERVIEW:

   This document describes how to get a REST::Resource CGI script
   running.

PREREQUISITES:

    It is assumed that you have a webserver in mind.  If not, you may
    want to look at INSTALL.WWW-Resource-FRAMEWORK, by Ira Woodhead.

APACHE CGI CONFIGURATION:

    In httpd.conf (sometimes found in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf),
    make sure this section is enabled.

        LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so
        #
        # AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers":
        # actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
        # or added with the Action directive (see below)
        #
        # To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories:
        # (You will also need to add "ExecCGI" to the "Options" directive.)
        #
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

INSTALL SAMPLE FILES:

    Copy ./eg/*.cgi to some directory that you have R/W access to and
    set the execute permissions appropriately.

        mkdir /var/www/html/parts/
        chmod 777 /var/www/html/parts/
        cp ./eg/parts.cgi /var/www/html/parts/
	chmod 755 /var/www/html/parts/parts.cgi

SAMPLE URLS:

    http://localhost/parts/parts.cgi
    http://localhost/parts/parts.cgi/api

DATA SETS:

    Once you have generated some parts and descriptions in a browser,
    you can start trying to retrieve these parts / data simply.
