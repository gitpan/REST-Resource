ROAD MAP:

     Add example support to use something like Atom responses instead
     of just "xml".  This will be "application/atom+xml" and will
     likely override the default "xml" XML::Dumper implementation.

BLUE SKY IDEAS:

     Look at Atom Publishing Protocol support.  The samples are
     functional, but they are doing work that arguably should be done
     at the base class.
